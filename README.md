### Team Guidelines:

* CamelCase for JavaScript id's.
* kebab-case for CSS Classes.
* snake_case for multiple word file names.
* comments for code clarification.
* ES6 on backend and ES5 on the frontend.
* all team members should understand code before approval (comments on PR).


**Git Flow**
* Split each user story into technical tasks.
* Assign yourself to a task and add the `in-progress` label.
* Small commits with each sub-task of the technical issue.
* Create a `[WIP]` branch.
* Once the work is complete remove `[WIP]` and assign each team member to review.
* Remove the `in-progress` label and add the `awaiting-review` label and to the issue and PR.
* Request changes if appropriate.
* The final person to approve the PR should assign both QAs to review.
* Close issue *after* the PR has been merged and all tasks relating to the issue are complete.

### Stretch Goals:
* Ability to delete a job from the list of matched jobs.
* User authentication.
* Use of logic for browsing job options.
* Expand data to include colleges.
* Expand data to include more jobs.
